# Sprint2
Lets get after it!


this project will be an extension of sprint 1.

I think it might be helpful if we work in the "workspace" branch and when you're happy with your work you can send it to rough branch. Rough branch can be a place where we all review it and then we can agree to commit it to the main branch. Let me know what you guys think of this. Might be a little to complicated..
