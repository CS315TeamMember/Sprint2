# Sprint2
Lets get after it!


this project will be an extension of sprint 1.

I think it might be helpful if whenever you do any work you create your own branch maybe call it "Alex's progress". Then it might be a good idea if another person reviews it (agrees with the code) and then pulls it to main and deletes the "Alex's progress" branch. Let me know what you think
